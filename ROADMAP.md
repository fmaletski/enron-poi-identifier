1. Review provided code and dataset. Change stuff to be run on python 3 if needed.

* poi_id.py
    + Changed tools path.
    + sklearn.cross_validation to sklearn.model_selection as per deprecation warning

* tester.py
    + print statements to functions
    + sklearn.cross_validation to sklearn.model_selection as per deprecation warning

* final_project_dataset.pkl
    + Used https://github.com/techtonik/dos2unix to convert it, new name final_project_dataset_py3.pkl


2. Import features to a workspace, overall exploration.
* Done.

3. Create prototype of algorithms.
*Done.*

4. Use CV to fine tune each algorithm (3 passes).

5. Evaluate performance, choose final algorithm.

6. Evaluate performance, write report.
